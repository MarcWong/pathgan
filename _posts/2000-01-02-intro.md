We introduce PathGAN, a deep neural network for visual
scanpath prediction trained on adversarial examples. A visual scanpath
is defined as the sequence of fixation points over an image defined by
a human observer with its gaze. PathGAN is composed of two parts,
the generator and the discriminator. Both parts extract features from
images using off-the-shelf networks, and train recurrent layers to gener-
ate or discriminate scanpaths accordingly. In scanpath prediction, the
stochastic nature of the data makes it very difficult to generate realistic
predictions using supervised learning strategies, but we adopt adversarial
training as a suitable alternative. Our experiments prove how PathGAN
improves the state of the art of visual scanpath prediction on the iSUN
and Salient360! datasets.
