<div style="text-align: justify">The modelis composed by two deep neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, whose combined efforts aim at predicting a realistic scanpath from a given image.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The model is trained following the cGAN framework to allow the predictions to be conditioned to an input image, encoded by a pre-trained convolutional neural network. The generator reads images as input and outputs a variable length sequence of predicted fixation points. In addition to the coordinates of the fixation points, our model has an end-of-sequence (EOS) neuron to encode the scanpath variable length behavior. The discriminator predicts if a given scanpath is synthesized or not, and this decision is conditioned to the associated image.</div>
